**Project Goal**: Identify factors influencing employee departures at IBM and develop a model to predict them.

**Data & Methodology**:
Analyzed IBM HR data (Kaggle) on job satisfaction, work-life balance, age, etc.
Built a model using Multiple Linear Regression to predict employee attrition risk.

**Key Findings**:
Job satisfaction, work-life balance, job level (seniority), age, and income all correlate with employee retention.
Overtime is a significant predictor of employee departures.
The model explains 14.4% of the variation in employee attrition, suggesting other factors are at play.

**Limitations:**
Limited data scope (e.g., lacks leadership, culture aspects).
Small sample size may affect generalizability.
Model can't definitively prove causation.

**Conclusion:**
This project identified key factors influencing employee attrition at IBM. Further research with a wider range of variables and potentially more advanced models is recommended.
